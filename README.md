# IPL Live Match Score and Points Table Power BI Dashboard üèèüìä

## Business Problem Statement
The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 draws significant attention from cricket fans and analysts worldwide, creating a need for an accessible and comprehensive platform that provides real-time updates and detailed statistics. Current resources are often fragmented, requiring users to visit multiple sources to gather information on match scores, player statistics, and rankings. This lack of a unified source makes it challenging for fans and analysts to track teams and monitor ongoing events.

The business problem is the absence of a single, easy-to-use dashboard that delivers all essential IPL-related information in real time. A comprehensive dashboard would allow users to stay informed about match scores, player statistics, and team rankings. It would also offer interactive visuals and in-depth analytics, catering to a wide range of users from casual fans to professional analysts. Solving this problem would create a one-stop solution that enhances the user experience during the IPL 2024 season.
