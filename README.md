# IPL Real-Time Match Score and Points Table Power BI Dashboard üèèüìä

## Identifying the Business Challenge
The IPL 2024 season garners immense interest from cricket enthusiasts and analysts globally. However, the fragmented nature of available resources poses a challenge, necessitating a consolidated platform for real-time updates and detailed statistics. This dispersion makes it arduous for fans and analysts to track teams and stay updated on ongoing events.

## Crafting the Solution
Addressing this challenge involves developing a unified and user-friendly dashboard that provides comprehensive IPL-related information in real time. Such a dashboard would empower users with up-to-date match scores, player statistics, and team rankings, catering to a diverse audience from casual fans to seasoned analysts. Bridging this gap would enhance user engagement throughout the IPL 2024 season.
